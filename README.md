##### Q: What Actually Does This Do?
##### A: This makes it easier to use Livestreamer to view twitch streamer while also getting rid of the ads.
<br>
<br>

##### Q: Why Would You Make This?
##### A: Well, i was bored and i wanted to practice a little bit of batch so i could automate some stuff.

<br>
<br>

##### Q: Why Are There 2 Files?
##### A: One of them checks to see if the other is running. If it is, is checks again later. If not, it starts it. I originally had it so that you would have to edit the batch file and paste in the stream link so it would automaticly load the stream incase the streamer or myself lost connection that does not happen any more as you select the stream and quality you want.

##### Q: If It Just Checks To See If The Other is Running, Do I Need Both Files?
##### A: No. You Only Need Stream, The "Start" File If The One That Checks.
